# theWeatherManForecast

## Description

This Weather Dashboard is for users looking to see the current and future weather for a city of their choice. This project is built to create easy access to users to see the 5 day forecast. It also offers simplicity as it will display your recent searches for easy access to view the weather again. The main goal is to provide an easy efficient weather dashboard for everyone to use. 

As an aspriring web developer I want to create a simple weather application that allows a user to see recent searches and see the current weather and the 5 day forecast for the specified location. 

## Installation 

N/A

## Usage

When I search for a city, then I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When I view current weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed. When I view future weather conditions for that city, then I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When I click on a city in the search history then, I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
